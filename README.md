# BookStore
It is a Bookstore built using SQLite database , GUI using tkinter.
One can add , view and delete the book details .
This program contains both front-end and back-end code for a bookstore app with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter library. Tkinter serves well in terms of getting me familiar with how to connect to databases(SQLite in this case), manipulatie data, and reflect the changes on the front end with Python.

The program supports all 4 essentail CRUD functionalities and I also manage to package the program into a standalone executable file for production/distribution using py2app library.
